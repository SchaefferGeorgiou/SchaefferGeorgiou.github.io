                My foray into audio and visual programming! It was originally a project for my Immersive Game Technologies module where we needed to create an interactable piece of software using OpenGL.
                <br><br>
                The idea was to have a 3D sphere whose surface would have vertices extruded depending on the wave file read in. Creating a visual representation of the audio data that could be rotated freely while the wave file played...
                <br>
                This was going to be achieved by using an <a href="https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile" target="_blank">external wave file reader</a>, <a href="https://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_sphere.html" target="_blank"> <s>stolen</s> borrowed code to render a sphere </a>, <a href="https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft" target="_blank">OpenALSoft</a> to play a sound, and finally <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">ImGui</a> for the UI elements and interaction.
                <br><br>
                A bold decision, as someone who had no experience with binary file reading, minimal understanding of 3D rendering, and somehow less knowledge about audio playback...

                <br><br>
                So none of the audio aspect was done by hand-in, but I was able to have the sphere rotate and change the amount of vertices on the sphere. As that was the main thing required to prove I understood the principles at hand.

                <br>
                Main thing I'd do differently is not try to add an entire language to a project I wasn't going to be marked on.
                BUT I am currently re-attempting the project! Trying to complete the original idea. I've recently finished my wave file reader, which has given me an understanding of binary file reading, file structures, and PCM data.
                Code hell, but educational code hell.

            <h2>Rhythm Strategy (Working Title)</h2>

                "Is there a Strategy Rhythm game?"
                <br>
                Is what I asked myself and thus my Honours project was born!
                <br><br>
                My first project in Unreal Engine 5, made using a majority C++, with some blueprints to access the Quartz Subsystem. A built-in event system on a fixed tick using Unreal's audio thread, which was used to have the entities in the game act on the beat.
                This, and a combination of purpose-built classes that lean into UnrealEngine's use of inheritance to make referencing all objects and Units simpler. I created a simple damage system separate from UnrealEngine's built-in system to better understand relationships between actors and avoid all the extra functionality I wouldn't be using.
                <br><br>
                In terms of art I made use of simple geometric shapes and simple colours to minimise the amount of modeling and texturing necessary.
                A lot of nice-to-haves were dropped due to the creeping deadline, but I do aim to develop this idea further and fine-tune the issues currently present.
                <br><br>
                I definitely did not manage my time as effectively as I could, focusing far too much on finding perfect solutions to problems rather than just getting something MADE. I learned a lot trying to deal with how the blueprint system wrapped methods I added and trying to use that in tandem with my live-coding. It was painful and a lot of restarting was required, but I found a workflow and learned what to look out for.
                For future I would likely keep the 2 in their own realms and not trying to interweave blueprints with C++ as one would often break the other. Lastly I'd like to try add a <b>SET AMOUNT</b> of features to truly represent what I think could be a really fun experience.

                A fun group project we created for our Team Enterprise module in Uni. I was the Co-Project Manager responsible for audio, art, partial modelling, meetings, and project-level documentation (risk assessments, etc.).
                I created the card flip animations, card models, the music, the sound effects, and the audio manager script used in the game. We first went through a paper mock-up of the game which gave us a baseline in terms of testing and helped pin-point what needs work, which we did iterate on successfully.
                We used Agile and Scrum principles, having regular sprint meetings to update and review the project, adjusting goals to better adapt to issues that arose.
                <br><br>

                Things I'd do differently: I'd put more of an emphasis on note-taking DURING development as there were many aspects that weren't communicated clearly due the size of the team and different work-styles.
                There is a slight mis-match in aesthetics via texturing, and there is often a lot on screen which is not communicated in the most efficient way, which can lead to confusion in what to do next.
                From a UX standpoint, the mechanics themselves often left people confused (and even confused the team occasionally), hence the big red help screen. Which was the most we could do at the time, but could definitely be better explained through a step-by-step tutorial.
                <br><br>
                This was a very stressful project due to some issues that arose within the team, but it was all handled constructively and I'm proud of what we were able to achieve.
