                My foray into audio and visual programming! It was originally a project for my Immersive Game Technologies module where we needed to create an interactable piece of software using OpenGL.
                <br><br>
                The idea was to have a 3D sphere whose surface would have vertices extruded depending on the wave file read in. Creating a visual representation of the audio data that could be rotated freely while the wave file played...
                <br>
                This was going to be achieved by using an <a href="https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile" target="_blank">external wave file reader</a>, <a href="https://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_sphere.html" target="_blank"> <s>stolen</s> borrowed code to render a sphere </a>, <a href="https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft" target="_blank">OpenALSoft</a> to play a sound, and finally <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">ImGui</a> for the UI elements and interaction.
                <br><br>
                A bold decision, as someone who had no experience with binary file reading, minimal understanding of 3D rendering, and somehow less knowledge about audio playback...

                <br><br>
                So none of the audio aspect was done by hand-in, but I was able to have the sphere rotate and change the amount of vertices on the sphere. As that was the main thing required to prove I understood the principles at hand.

                <br>
                Main thing I'd do differently is not try to add an entire language to a project I wasn't going to be marked on.
                BUT I am currently re-attempting the project! Trying to complete the original idea. I've recently finished my wave file reader, which has given me an understanding of binary file reading, file structures, and PCM data.
                Code hell, but educational code hell.

            <h2>Rhythm Strategy (Working Title)</h2>

            <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">

                "Is there a Strategy Rhythm game?"
                <br>
                Is what I asked myself and thus my Honours project was born!
                <br><br>
                My first project in Unreal Engine 5, made using a majority C++, with some blueprints to access the Quartz Subsystem. A built-in event system on a fixed tick using Unreal's audio thread, which was used to have the entities in the game act on the beat.
                This, and a combination of purpose-built classes that lean into UnrealEngine's use of inheritance to make referencing all objects and Units simpler. I created a simple damage system separate from UnrealEngine's built-in system to better understand relationships between actors and avoid all the extra functionality I wouldn't be using.
                <br><br>
                In terms of art I made use of simple geometric shapes and simple colours to minimise the amount of modeling and texturing necessary.
                A lot of nice-to-haves were dropped due to the creeping deadline, but I do aim to develop this idea further and fine-tune the issues currently present.
                <br><br>
                I definitely did not manage my time as effectively as I could, focusing far too much on finding perfect solutions to problems rather than just getting something MADE. I learned a lot trying to deal with how the blueprint system wrapped methods I added and trying to use that in tandem with my live-coding. It was painful and a lot of restarting was required, but I found a workflow and learned what to look out for.
                For future I would likely keep the 2 in their own realms and not trying to interweave blueprints with C++ as one would often break the other. Lastly I'd like to try add a <b>SET AMOUNT</b> of features to truly represent what I think could be a really fun experience.

                A fun group project we created for our Team Enterprise module in Uni. I was the Co-Project Manager responsible for audio, art, partial modelling, meetings, and project-level documentation (risk assessments, etc.).
                I created the card flip animations, card models, the music, the sound effects, and the audio manager script used in the game. We first went through a paper mock-up of the game which gave us a baseline in terms of testing and helped pin-point what needs work, which we did iterate on successfully.
                We used Agile and Scrum principles, having regular sprint meetings to update and review the project, adjusting goals to better adapt to issues that arose.
                <br><br>

                Things I'd do differently: I'd put more of an emphasis on note-taking DURING development as there were many aspects that weren't communicated clearly due the size of the team and different work-styles.
                There is a slight mis-match in aesthetics via texturing, and there is often a lot on screen which is not communicated in the most efficient way, which can lead to confusion in what to do next.
                From a UX standpoint, the mechanics themselves often left people confused (and even confused the team occasionally), hence the big red help screen. Which was the most we could do at the time, but could definitely be better explained through a step-by-step tutorial.
                <br><br>
                This was a very stressful project due to some issues that arose within the team, but it was all handled constructively and I'm proud of what we were able to achieve.

                Transport lost souls through the underworld! But be careful, there are plenty of hazards to slow you down and you're on the clock...
                <br>
                An arcade time-attack, train game. You control the acceleration and tilt of your train to avoid hazards and turn as efficiently as possible to keep your speed.
                <br><br>
                I was responsible for some of the environment models (rocks and cliffs), implementing the audio system used for playing all the sound in the game, and I composed the music used in the main menu, levels, all the sound effects for button clicks, win-screens, and train sounds.
                <br><br>
                A very fun project that taught me a lot about how to coordinate with different disciplines and how different parts of a game come together. With a plethora of things to be done better since it was one of our first team projects. We had a lot of "fun" figuring out the quirks of Github and Unity...A lot of progress was lost more than once.
                <br>
                The system I had for audio did not scale well. It used a string to find the correct sound in an array, and I unfortuantely couldn't spend time optimising the search and was yet unaware of maps, but with the hand-full of sounds we had, it worked quite well. I even got Unity to change the pitch of a single file with each consecutive tilt!

                <br><br>
                With a combination of really talented artists and extremely intelligent coders (and myself), I'm SUPER happy with how this project ended up looking and feeling, and I hope I get the chance to work with my friends again at some point in the future.

                <br>
                My first ever game project which I'm still proud of. Created using Unity, I drew all the art assets, created all the music and sound effects, and coded all the enemies and controls.
                <br><br>
                The enemies were the most challenging bit, giving them all unique approaches to messing with the player. The fiery demons charge at you, the blobs shoot negative words at you, and the tendril ones summon more of them while keeping their distance.
                They each feel unique visually and they have clear damage states that took FOREVER to set-up with the state-animation in Unity. There was even a fun "feature" where you could shoot the negative words to cancel them, which was kept because I liked the theming around that.
                <br>
                I bit off far more than I should have for this (noticing a pattern?), The art was not a marked part of the project and the enemy AI pathing was clunky and did not account for obstacles. The tiles didn't always align with physics boundaries, which led to awkward overlaps, and in the executeable there's a fun bug that crashes the game when you win. 
                <br><br>
                But despite all it's flaws it's project where I learned I could create whatever I wanted (within reason). And I will always have on a pedestal, with all its flaws.
